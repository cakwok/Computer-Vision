## Description

Hello world to computer vision!  In this project, the aim is to apply filters to live stream video pixel by pixel by C++. 

I have built Guassian filter from scratch, created grayscale live video, applied gradient magnitude to locate edges, quantized a live video with color thresholdings, cartoonization, mirroring an image, contrast, meme generation and video recording, and recorded result as below.

### Greyscale by cvtcolor

As depicted by cvtColor documentation from opencv.org, grayscale is weighted by 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B. It could be observed that the green channel is lower in intensity (when compared with the greyscaling by copying a color channel below).

### Greyscale by copying one channel to the others

To compare the effect of color channel weighting, at this task, I have chosen to copy B channel to other channels.  It can be seen the green channel is showing more intensity (less dark).  Also observed loss of quality by copying channels. 

### Blurring

Applied Sobel x and Sobel y filter, then applied the result of the magnitude into gradient magnitude.

### Quantizing

Cartoonization by magnitude threshold 20.

### Others - Allow user adjusting Contrast

Filter : 1.2 * pixel value + 20.

### Extension 1 - Mirror

Courtesy in video meetings/recording to let the player knows that it is currently recording.

### Extension 4 - Overlay

Happy Chinese New year!  Extension 4 is to overlay 2 images.
