#### Homework1 - To the power of
To compare computational time difference between full formular and C++ POW function.

#### Project1 - Real Time Video Filtering

Developed with C++, OpenCV, to build a live video system with special effect from scratch, by applying blur filters, gradient magnitude, quantization, cartoonization and live video recording.

#### Project4 - Project4 - Calibration and Augmented Reality
Developed with C++, OpenCV, to build an augmented reality application.

#### Project6 - Generative and Adversarial Network

Developed with Pytorch, the codes and to generate handwritten digit letters and color images, and study the differences and performances between general GAN, cGAN, DCGAN.
